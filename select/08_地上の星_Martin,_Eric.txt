A Glimpse of Pleiades in the breeze
In the wind is a sandy universe
All of our heroes have disappeared
Never had the chance to get what they deserve
Out in the field is a Pegasus
Venus on the corner of a street
Tell me where have all the people gone
Never had the chance to get what they deserve
All of us have seem to forgotten
The stars that we have on earth
None of us can help but gaze into the sky
Tell me, swallow
What do you see from above?
Where is the light? The stars we have on our land
Tell me, swallow
Where have the glory gone?
Where have all the stars
On earth, on our planet gone?

On a cliff I can see Jupiter
Under the water is a Sirius
All of our heroes have disappeared
Never had the chance to get what they deserve
Running after fame and glory
The result is a same old story
People and up grasping ice and they shiver
Tell me, swallow
What do you see form above?
Where is the lights? The stars of our planet
Tell me, swallow
Where have the glory gone?
Where have all the stars
On earth, on our planet gone?

Running after fame and glory
The result is a same old story
People and up grasping ice and they shiver
A Glimpse of pleiades in the breeze
In the wind is a sandy universe
All of our heroes have disappeared
Never had the chance to get what they deserve
Tell me, swallow
What do you see from above?
Where is the light? The stars we have on our planet
Tell me, swallow
Where have the glory gone?
Where have all the stars
On earth, on our planet gone?
