kaze no naka no subaru
suna no naka no ginga
minna doko e itta miokurareru koto mo naku
sougen no PEGASASU
machikado no VIINASU
minna doko e itta mimamorareru koto mo naku
chijou ni aru hoshi o dare mo oboeteinai
hito wa sora bakari miteru
tsubame yo takai sora kara oshiete yo chijou no hoshi o
tsubame yo chijou no hoshi wa ima doko ni aru no darou
In the winds of Pleiades
In the dust of the Milky Way
Everyone went somewhere without being seen off
In the savannah of Pegasus
On the street-corner of Venus
Everyone went somewhere without being watched over
No one remembered the stars of Earth
People see nothing but the sky
Oh swallow! Teach from the high sky! The stars of Earth
Oh swallow! Where are the stars of Earth now?

gake no ue no JUPITAA
minasoko no SHIRIUSU
minna doko e itta mimamorareru koto mo naku
nadataru mono o otte kagayaku mono o otte
hito wa koori bakari tsukamu
tsubame yo takai sora kara oshiete yo chijou no hoshi o
tsubame yo chijou no hoshi wa ima doko ni aru no darou
Atop the cliffs of Jupiter
On the seafloor of Sirius
Everyone went somewhere without being watched over
Chase that which is famous; chase that which shines
People grasp nothing but ice
Oh swallow! Teach from the high sky! The stars of Earth
Oh swallow! Where are the stars of Earth now?
